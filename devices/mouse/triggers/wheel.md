## Description
Performed by using a scroll wheel.

Wheel triggers can have two different lifecycles - if the trigger has an ``on: update`` action and a mouse button or keyboard modifier is present, the trigger
begins on the first scroll event and ends when a modifier/button is released, otherwise it begins and ends on the same scroll event.
