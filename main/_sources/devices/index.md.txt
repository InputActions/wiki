## DeviceRule
Applies a set of properties to all devices that satisfy the rule's conditions (if present).

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Property
  - Type
  - Description
  - Default

* - conditions
  - *[](/conditions/index)* or *list([](/conditions/index))*
  - Must be satisfied in order for this rule to be applied.

    If the value is a list, the behavior is the same as an ``all`` [](/conditions/group).
  -

* - ignore
  - *bool*
  - Ignore all events generated by the device.
  - ``false``
:::

In addition to global properties listed above, some devices also have an additional set of properties listed on their pages
(<project:/devices/touchpad/index.md#touchpadproperties>).

Rule conditions use a separate set of variables that describe the device for which a rule is currently being evaluated for:
:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Name
  - Type
  - Description

* - name
  - *string*
  -

* - types
  - *flags(keyboard, mouse, touchpad)*
  - Certain devices may have multiple types (e.g. mouse and keyboard).

### Examples
```yaml
device_rules:
  - conditions: $name == Synaptics TM3276-02
    ignore: false # don't ignore this device, overrides the rule below
    
  - conditions: $types contains mouse
    # ...
    
  - ignore: true # ignore all devices by default
```
