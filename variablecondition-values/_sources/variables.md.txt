:::

All variables of the *point* type have variants with the ``_x`` and ``_y`` suffixes that return the X and Y values respectively.

``window_`` variables have ``window_under_`` variants that return information about the window the pointer is hovering over.

## Expansion
String, bool, number variables can be referenced (``$name``) in command actions and will be replaced. Expansion currently cannot be prevented.

## Listing variables
Some information that the user may need during configuration is exposed through variables. Run ``qdbus org.inputactions / variables`` to list all
variables and their current values, can be combined with ``watch -n [time] [command]`` to update automatically.
